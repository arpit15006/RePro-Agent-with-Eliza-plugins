# 🧬 Hypothesis Generator Plugin

An Eliza-compatible plugin that generates novel research hypotheses from knowledge graphs using AI-powered analysis and scientific reasoning.

## 🎯 Purpose

Analyzes enriched knowledge graphs to identify research gaps and generate novel, testable scientific hypotheses for advancing research frontiers.

## ✨ Features

- **Knowledge Graph Analysis**: Processes RDF knowledge graphs
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Uses LLMs for intelligent hypothesis creation
- **Research Gap Identification**: Identifies unexplored research areas
- **Novelty Scoring**: Evaluates hypothesis originality and potential impact
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Estimates research feasibility and resource requirements
- **Focus Area Targeting**: Generates hypotheses for specific research domains

## 📥 Input

- Knowledge graph file (Turtle or JSON format)
- Optional: Number of hypotheses to generate
- Optional: Research focus area
- Optional: AI model selection

## 📤 Output

```json
{
  "generated_hypotheses": [
    {
      "hypothesis": "Combining CRISPR-Cas9 with dataset X could improve gene editing precision by 25%",
      "rationale": "Both tools have complementary strengths that could address current limitations",
      "methodology": "Develop integrated pipeline and benchmark against existing methods",
      "feasibility": "medium",
      "novelty_score": 0.8,
      "required_resources": ["computational resources", "domain expertise"],
      "expected_impact": "Advance understanding in gene editing field"
    }
  ],
  "research_directions": [
    "Methodological improvements and novel approaches",
    "Interdisciplinary collaboration opportunities"
  ],
  "knowledge_gaps": [
    "Limited dataset availability for validation",
